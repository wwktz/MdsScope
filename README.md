# MdsScope

MdsScope is a C++/Qt desktop application for browsing WebScope-style shot
configuration files (`*.webscp`) and plotting MDSplus signal data through MDSIP.

It is intended to be a transparent, open-source alternative to older Java 8 based
WebScope-style clients, which can be difficult to maintain on newer Java
runtimes. The application is currently EAST-specific: the bundled signal
configuration, MDSIP defaults, login flow, and HTTP metadata API target EAST.

## Features

- Load TOML and WebScope-style `.webscp` environment files.
- Plot multiple synchronized MDSplus signal panels.
- Three sampling quality modes: **thin** (fast preview), **medium** (high-resolution), and **full** (complete data).
- Apply single-shot or batch-shot expressions globally.
- Use EAST HTTP metadata for latest shot and top-bar shot summary.
- Run on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

### Sampling Quality Modes

MdsScope offers three data sampling modes to balance speed and precision:

- **Thin** (default): Fast preview mode for quick trend visualization.

- **Medium**: Higher-resolution sampled mode using real measured values. Recommended when spike amplitude matters.

- **Full**: Reads all raw data with no sampling. Use for detailed analysis of specific time ranges.

The mode can be set globally via the top toolbar dropdown, or overridden per signal in the source setup dialog. When zoomed to small time ranges, the application automatically uses full precision regardless of the selected mode.

## Requirements

- CMake 3.16 or newer
- A C++23 compiler
- Qt 6.4 or newer with Core, Widgets, Network, and Concurrent
- Qt 6 DBus on Linux

### Dependency Installation

Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential cmake qt6-base-dev qt6-base-dev-tools
```

macOS:

```bash
xcode-select --install
brew install cmake qt
```

Windows: install Visual Studio 2022 with the C++ desktop workload, CMake, and a
matching Qt 6 MSVC build.

## Build and Install

Prebuilt DEB, RPM, Linux portable ZIP, Apple Silicon macOS, and Windows
packages are published from Git tags.

### Prebuilt Linux Packages

Install the DEB matching the Ubuntu release and architecture:

```bash
sudo apt install ./mdsscope-ubuntu24.04.amd64.deb
```

Install the RPM matching Fedora 44, Enterprise Linux 9, or Enterprise Linux 10:

```bash
sudo dnf install ./mdsscope-fedora44.x86_64.rpm
sudo dnf install ./mdsscope-el10.x86_64.rpm
```

The EL9 package uses Qt 6 from EPEL 9. On Rocky Linux 9 or AlmaLinux 9, enable
CRB and EPEL before installing it:

```bash
sudo dnf install dnf-plugins-core
sudo dnf config-manager --set-enabled crb
sudo dnf install epel-release
sudo dnf install ./mdsscope-el9.x86_64.rpm
```

The portable Linux ZIP includes Qt and the other non-system runtime libraries.
It does not need to be installed:

```bash
unzip mdsscope-linux-x86_64.zip
./MdsScope/MdsScope
```

### Prebuilt macOS Packages

The macOS packages target Apple Silicon (`arm64`). They are ad-hoc signed for
Apple Silicon but are not signed with an Apple Developer ID and are not
notarized. Gatekeeper may therefore block the first launch.

For the DMG, open it, drag `MdsScope.app` into `Applications`, then Control-click
the installed app and select **Open**. If macOS still blocks it, use **Open
Anyway** under **System Settings → Privacy & Security**. As a per-app Terminal
fallback:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/MdsScope.app
open /Applications/MdsScope.app
```

For the ZIP binary package, extract and launch it directly:

```bash
ditto -x -k mdsscope-macos-arm64.zip .
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine ./MdsScope.app
open ./MdsScope.app
```

Only remove the quarantine attribute from packages downloaded from the official
MdsScope GitHub Releases page. Do not disable Gatekeeper globally.

### Prebuilt Windows Package

The Windows ZIP is portable and includes the required Qt DLLs. Extract it and
run `MdsScope.exe`; no installer or setup wizard is required.

### Build from Source

To build from source:

Linux:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build -j
./build/MdsScope
```

macOS:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$(brew --prefix qt)"
cmake --build build -j
open ./build/MdsScope.app
```

Windows:

```powershell
cmake -S . -B build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64
cmake --build build --config Release
.\build\Release\MdsScope.exe
```

Install from a source build when needed:

Linux:

```bash
cmake --install build
```

For non-root Linux installs, the default command-line prefix is `~/.local`.

macOS:

```bash
# GUI app bundle
cmake --install build --prefix "$HOME/Applications" --component app

# Command-line tools and shared resources
cmake --install build --prefix "$HOME/.local" --component tools
```

## Configuration

On first run, MdsScope creates a user configuration directory and copies bundled
templates if it is empty:

```text
Linux:   ~/.config/mdsscope/
macOS:   ~/Library/Application Support/mdsscope/
Windows: %LOCALAPPDATA%\MdsScope\
```

`auth.cache` does not store credentials in plaintext. Its contents are
obfuscated and bound to the current machine/user to reduce accidental
disclosure. It is not designed to protect credentials from software running
with the same user privileges.

MdsScope supports native `*.toml` files and legacy WebScope-compatible
`*.webscp` files. The default template is `init.toml`; saving from the GUI keeps
TOML and WEBSCP files synchronized.

Example TOML:

```toml
version = 1

[[panels]]
column = 1
row = 1
title = "Plasma current"
x_label = "s"
y_label = "kA"

[[panels.signals]]
tree = "pcs_east"
server = "202.127.204.12"
y = "\\pcrl01"
read_mode = "full"
```

Panels use the shot shown in the MdsScope UI. A signal-level `shot` value is
only needed for explicit per-signal shot overrides, such as shot comparison.

Shot fields support single shots, semicolon lists, ranges, and mixed
expressions:

```text
143850
143850;143851;143853
143850-143858
143850-143858;143865
```

Useful signal options include `shot`, `hidden = true`, and
`read_mode = "medium"` or `read_mode = "full"` for per-signal data mode
overrides.

Convert legacy `.webscp` files with `transfer`:

```bash
./build/transfer resources/environment/init.webscp
./build/transfer --recursive resources/environment
```

On Windows source builds, use the executable under `build\Release`:

```powershell
.\build\Release\transfer.exe ".\resources\environment\init.webscp"
.\build\Release\transfer.exe --recursive --out-dir ".\converted" ".\resources\environment"
```

### EAST HTTP Metadata API

The EAST HTTP metadata endpoint is stored in `resources/APIurl`. It is used for
latest shot lookup and the top-bar summary. Plot data continues to come from
EAST MDSIP.

### SSH Remote Access

Use the SSH button next to Login to tunnel MDSIP data and EAST metadata when
they are only reachable from an internal network. Linux, macOS, and Windows are
supported when a system OpenSSH client is available. The SSH server may run on
any platform, but it must allow TCP forwarding and reach the required internal
services.

Authentication supports a password, a selected identity file, or the default
OpenSSH configuration and `ssh-agent` when both are left empty. Saved SSH
settings are stored in the machine-bound encrypted user cache.

SSH access is slower than a direct internal-network connection because of
unavoidable network, encryption, and compression overhead. Users are responsible
for using only trusted, authorized SSH hosts and for complying with applicable
network and security policies.

The browser button next to SSH lets users save named HTTP or HTTPS addresses,
edit them, and open them in the system default browser. No target addresses are included by default.
When an SSH data tunnel is already connected, saved web addresses use the same
SSH forwarding path; otherwise they open normally. URLs with explicit ports are
supported.

### Data Export

Data export supports text, CSV, TSV, and JSON formats. By default, exported
files are written under:

```text
Linux:   ~/Downloads/mdsscope/output/
macOS:   ~/Downloads/mdsscope/output/
Windows: %USERPROFILE%\Downloads\mdsscope\output\  (usual location)
```

## Benchmark Mode

MdsScope includes a simple benchmark mode for MDS data loading:

```bash
./build/MdsScope --benchmark resources/environment/your_config.webscp --summary
```

## Repository Hygiene

Do not commit:

- access tokens
- local auth caches
- build artifacts

The EAST API URL is intentionally stored in `resources/APIurl`; do not commit
personal tokens or cache files.
